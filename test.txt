21 Blackjack is a two-player card game where each player starts with two cards
from a deck of cards valued 1-11.
Each player's first card is face down and only that player knows its value.
Every other card is face up and can be seen by both players.
The goal is to finish the round with the higher score,
but if you go over 21, you lose.
Players can choose to Draw or Stick.
To Draw is to take another card from the shared deck.
To Stick is to keep the cards you have.
The game ends when both players Stick consecutively.
